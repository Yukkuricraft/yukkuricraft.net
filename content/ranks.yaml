        the community, and have been noticed for your actions. You're one of the
        community leaders. Inactive and troublesome elders can be demoted. This

      displayName: Titles
      description: >-
        There are also special "Titles" within the staff ranks. "Titles" are
        just that. Titles. They're a way to differentiate slightly different
        purposes within the same overall rank.
      ranks:
        - name: The [Lead] Title
          italics: true
          description: >-
            Staff with this title are designated as the "heads" of their
            respective rank. They're the gold standard for their teams and
            dedicate the most time. While equal to other staff, their efforts
            definitely do not go without recognition.

        The following list consists of the main permission-tampering ranks that
        are most regularly seen. These ranks are also allowed to hack their
        games so as long as they do not use the hacks for cheating in survival
        mode. (Does not apply for Staff Trainee.)
      ranks:
        - name: Staff Trainee
          description: >-
            Trainees are temp-staff with limited permissions. These are people
            we're currently running through a trial role to see if they'd make a
            good fit for the team. Even if the rank is temporary, they are still
            considered staff members so don't hesitate to ask them for help if
            one's around!

            of Gensokyo's structures.

        - name: Sysadmin
          description: >-
            These staff are responsible for the technology side of Yukkuricraft.
            Think server, plugins, discord bots, etc. While sysadmin have access

            outrank Yukkuri Admins in regards to the community.

    The following ranks are special ranks that you don't see as often, but serve
    a purpose for specific circumstances.
  ranks:
    - name: Probation
      description: >-
        People who have been previously permanently banned, but are being given
        another chance to redeem their self. If this person screws up even once,
        they will most likely go back to being permanently banned and will no
        longer receive any chances for redemption in the future. It takes a lot
        to get this rank, you'd have to basically try to get it in order to get
        it.

    - name: Temp. Youkai
      description: >-
        Someone who has been temporarily granted permission to build in Gensokyo
