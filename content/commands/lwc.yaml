        one can protect it.
      tags: [lwc, chest, protection]

    - aliases: [cpassword]
      description:
        Password-protect a block. Each time you login you need to enter the
        password to access it. (If someone else knows the password, they can
        access it too.)
      tags: [lwc, chest, protection]

    - aliases: [cprivate]
      description:
        'Create a private protection. Private means private: you can also allow
        other users or groups to access the block as well. This is done by
        adding them after "private". You can add more than one group and/or user
        per command. When you prefix a User or Group with an ''@'', this
        User/Group will be able to modify the block and add other users. They
        cannot disable the owner from modifying it.'
      tags: [lwc, chest, protection]

    - aliases: [cmodify]
      description:
        Modify an existing protection, adding or removing users and/or groups.
        See /lwc create, the example for private protections. The same syntax is
        used for this command. There's an additional prefix however. Writing a
        '-' infront of a User or Group removes the access from the block.
