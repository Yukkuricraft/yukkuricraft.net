    Our community has made enormous contributions in building public farms for players to use.  
    If you lack certain resources or don't have the time to gather them yourself, we might
    have a farm for you! Do note that certain farms come with their own rules, which you must
    always obey.

    Listed below are active public farms, their coordinates, and builders in order of
    contribution.  
    If you too have built a farm for public use, contact a member of staff and we'll see to
    adding it onto this list.

        Sorry. Our new survival world recently started, so we don't have any public farms
        to showcase just yet. Check this place again soon and we will likely have some
        hotspots for you to check out.
