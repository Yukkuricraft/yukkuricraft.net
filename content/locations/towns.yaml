    Want to live with other players? Find it too boring not having neighbors?  
    Our survival map has towns that range from close community neighborhoods
    connected by a single road to massive cities with distinct cultures and styles.

    Towns usually accept any and all community members to live in them.  
    However, residential approval should only be done at the discretion of
    the town owners unless they release exceptions and that our following town
    policies are understood clearly:

    1.	Town owners are responsible for informing players wanting to live in
        the town of any build regulations and should provide clear
        documentation of said regulations.
    2.	Town owners may evict any offending residents in terms of said regulations.
        Exceptions to this right include failure to properly inform the resident
        of build regulations or unreasonable change of regulations.
    3.	Under the Remicare policy, town owners can Remicare resident houses
        should the Remicare requirements be met.
    4.	Players reserve the right and freedom to be residents in multiple towns
        and leave any town whenever they please unless this right is abused.

        While it isn't necessary for building or running a town, we do have an official
        township registry for town owners to apply to.  
        Being recognised as an official town grants a free warp straight from Kagome so
        other players can instantly come and check out your land.

        To apply for an official township status and have a warp added to Kagome, simply ask
        a member of staff. We'll come visit, take a look around, and discuss what we like about
        the place. If we like your town, we'll add it onto this website and let you have a warp
        installed in Kagome. Simple as that!

        Owners of officially-recognised towns can request a boat, airship, or train carriage at
        Kagome's docks or train station. These vehicles are equipped with a provided command block,
        allowing instantaneous teleportation between the two locations the vehicle is parked at.

        When requesting for a ship link to Kagome (or another town), the warp ship must meet the
        following requirements:

        1. Ships must be at maximum 11 blocks wide, 25 blocks long, and 40 blocks tall. Ships
        can be allowed to exceed the stated size requirements by a block if the said block is
        a “non-contact” block with the dock or airport borders, such as a banner, open trapdoor,
        or sign.
        2. Ships must have a space for a command block with some activation method for it.
        3. Ship design must be appropriate for its purpose.

        For trains:
        1. Your carriage must fit well with the general theme of the line you're building for
        (urban metro, steam engine, or fantasy).
        2. Your carriage must be the same length as the template carriages and mustn't be too much
        wider than the train itself. As with ships, "non-contact" blocks don't count when
        measuring the width of the carriage.
        3. Like ships, there must be space in the carriage for a command block and some activation
        method for it.

        Should the vehicle meet these requirements and the owner would like to request a
        link, they should double-check with a staff member, and then build the vehicle at their
        town/city dock (staff will not cover expenses for construction). Once done, they must
        contact staff again. The ship or carriage will then be copied and pasted at Kagome's
        docks, airport, or train station, and the proper commands implemented.

        Sorry. Our new survival world recently started, so no towns have been added to
        this page just yet. Check this place again soon and we will likely have some
        hotspots for you to check out.
