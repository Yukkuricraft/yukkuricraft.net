        Hi, Remi here. I've been around the Touhou Minecraft communities for
        about a decade now and helped found Yukkuricraft. These days, I mostly
        work on the tech side of things along with the help of a team of amazing
        staff. I'm not as responsive on Discord as some others, but feel free to
        shoot me a message if you ever have questions! (Remi#5619)

        Hi I'm Koko. I'm an Admin on Yukkuricraft. I basically make sure the
        temp builders and the builders are doing their jobs. Along with that, I
        would say I'm one of the driving forces behind Gensokyo 3 (still a
        W.I.P). If you ever want to work on Gensokyo don't feel afraid to step
        up. It doesn't matter if you're good or not good at building there's a
        place for everyone in the project here. Anyways, if you're ever
        interested in working on Gensokyo or becoming a Temp Builder just ask me
        or one of the builders! \o/

        cuddles, things that shine in the night sky, and just having fun. You'll
        often see me swing by the server to check up on what may be going down,
        build something in creative or for Gensokyo, or simply hang out. Feel
        free to message me if you need any help on the server or if you want to
        chat.

        Heya, I'm the local nyadmin Teshno. For the most part, I lurk around and
        try to remain playful and friendly, but I won't hesitate to deal with
        troublemakers, so please remain on your best behavior. I strive to keep
        our community moving forward, so I do what I can to oversee the server
        and its staff. If you need to ask me anything, I'm open for DM's under

        YukkuriCraft. I enjoy doing vanilla survival, to the point that I know
        many obscure mechanics that not many does. I sometimes do redstone, but
        I'm more of a researcher than an inventor. I'm situated in SEA, but if
        you need me, feel free to leave a message anytime. I'll try and get back
        to you if I'm not busy with work or sleep.
