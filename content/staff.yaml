        Hi, Remi here. I've been around the Touhou Minecraft communities for
        about a decade now and helped found Yukkuricraft. These days, I mostly
        work on the tech side of things along with the help of a team of amazing
        staff. I'm not as responsive on Discord as some others, but feel free to
        shoot me a message if you ever have questions! (remiscarlet)

        Hi I'm Koko. I'm an Admin on Yukkuricraft. I basically make sure the
        temp builders and the builders are doing their jobs. Along with that, I
        would say I'm one of the driving forces behind Gensokyo 3 (still a
        W.I.P). If you ever want to work on Gensokyo don't feel afraid to step
        up. It doesn't matter if you're good or not good at building there's a
        place for everyone in the project here. Anyways, if you're ever
        interested in working on Gensokyo or becoming a Temp Builder just ask me
        or one of the builders! \o/

        server to check up on what may be going down, build something in
        creative or for Gensokyo, or simply hang out. Feel free to message me if
        you need any help on the server or if you want to chat.

        Hi, we're Birb! Yes, we. We're a mediator on Yukkuricraft, and a

        from either Fresh (me lol) or Lynn (the one in the picture). Lynn's a
        fan of modded minecraft, CPM, and other nerdy things like programming
        and Warframe. I've recently been more into Mahjong, music, Yakuza, and
        bullying the local new player population. We're generally pretty
        available throughout the day, so don't be shy: we don't bite B)

        you need me, feel free to leave a message anytime. I'll try and get back
