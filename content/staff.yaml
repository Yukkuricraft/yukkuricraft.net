        Hi, Remi here. I've been around the Touhou Minecraft communities for
        about a decade now and helped found Yukkuricraft. These days, I mostly
        work on the tech side of things along with the help of a team of amazing
        staff. I'm not as responsive on Discord as some others, but feel free to
        shoot me a message if you ever have questions! (Remi#5619)

        Cyros here. I do a little bit of everything to help the community.
        Whether it's helping users with some issues, working on the Gensokyo
        project, dealing with problematic people, or just being a chill guy to
        chat with. I'm mostly on our Minecraft server, but feel free to DM me on
        Discord anytime. I will more than likely respond.

        Heya, I'm the local nyadmin Teshno. For the most part, I lurk around and
        try to remain playful and friendly, but I won't hesitate to deal with
        troublemakers, so please remain on your best behavior. I strive to keep
        our community moving forward, so I do what I can to oversee the server
        and its staff. If you need to ask me anything, I'm open for DM's.
        Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your stay~!

        Hi, I'm Katrix, the one that deal with the daily technical side of
        YukkuriCraft. Whether it's server plugins, the Minecraft version of the
        server or this website you're looking at right now. I'm the one that for
        the most part deals with it. I rarely peek out of my lurker den, but
        just tag me and I'll answer your question.

        love flowers, cuddles, things that shine in the night sky, and just
        having fun. You'll see me swing by the server to check up on what may be
        going down, build something in creative or for Gensokyo, or simply hang
        out. Feel free to message me if you need any help on the server or if
        you just want to chat.

        not do anything too stupid!

        Hey, TexasTony here. I'm one of the Mediators on the server and deal
        with moderating and helping the community. I enjoy building and
        occasionally help out with official server builds, such as Paintball and
        Gensokyo. I'm also the only Mediator to be situated near SEA, so if
        you're a player from that region, you'll most likely be encountering me
        quite a lot. If there's any questions or issues, feel free to notify me,
        I'll be happy to help. Enjoy your stay and remember to take it easy!

        P.S. As contrary to popular belief, no, I am not from Texas.

        Hi I'm Koko. I'm the Lead Builder on Yukkuricraft. I basically make sure
        the temp builders and the builders are doing their jobs. Along with
        that, I would say I'm one of the driving forces behind Gensokyo 3 (still
        a W.I.P). If you ever want to work on Gensokyo don't feel afraid to step
        up. It doesn't matter if you're good or not good at building there's a
        place for everyone in the project here. Anyways, if you're ever
        interested in working on Gensokyo or becoming a Temp Builder just ask me
        or one of the builders! \o/

        or just hanging around. I'm usually around on discord too so if you have
        questions regarding Genso or anything else feel free to ask.

        Hi there!

        I'm S121, but most people call me S1.  I am the Roleplay Moderator of
        the YC community, which means I usually organize the RP threads and
        resolve issues when they arise. I generally can be found playing
        Warframe, Minecraft, Halo, or whatever else catches my fancy. Tend to
        spend most of my time on Discord and am pretty easy to get along with.
        If you ever have a question, just give me a holler.
