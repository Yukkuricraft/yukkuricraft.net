Hello everyone. Today, we have a special announcement! Yukkuricraft is proud to announce that we're opening up partnerships with other communities. At the minimum, this involves providing links and promotion to each other's communities but we are open to other forms of collaboration.

To commemorate the unveiling of this new program, we are officially partnering with Paradise of Boundaries - the host of Bunbunmaru Extra! Please give all the love you can to this community for welcoming us onto their fan magazine and livestream, and for their continuing support in our endeavours!
Check out their links on our new ‚Å†official-partners channel on Discord.

(Partners will also be listed on our official website in due time. Please wait warmly for that.)
