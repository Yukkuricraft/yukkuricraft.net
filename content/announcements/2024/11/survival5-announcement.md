Ladies and gentlemen (and NB folk), the time has finally come. 
After a long period of back and forth work, we would like to proudly announce...

***Survival 5 is on the way!***

The staff (and our elders) have been hard at work getting the new Survival ready and in pristine shape to be pushed out for a special day that's coming up... That's right, Survival 5 is expected to be released on November 24th, Yukkuricraft's 12th anniversary!! Very fitting, is it not?

The server is expected to be properly updated to **__1.21.1__**, so get your mods and instances ready to go by then!

While these are very exciting news for everyone, please be sure to check out our Discord for any further details and events regarding Survival 5's release. We intend to let everyone give Survival 4 a proper send off before we update, so please keep an eye out for that!

With that said, we're once again excited to finally announce Survival 5! From the YC staff to you all, take it easy, everyone!
