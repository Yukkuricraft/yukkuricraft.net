Hey hey people, Tesh here

I wanna take a minute to remind people that Building Meetings (hosted twice a month, on the first and third Wednesday's,)
are not meant as a lounging get-together for people to hang out. These meetings are intended to provide regular periods
of focused progress on big projects in Gensokyo. If you wish to simply hang out, that in itself is fine, however please
keep irrelevant chatter to a minimum and allow the team to focus on their project, regardless if they are actively
speaking or not. A silent VC **doesn't require noise.**

As for VC etiquette overall, I understand staff have been relatively lenient but I would like people to start keeping a
better eye on themselves going forward. Unrelated chatter, talking over others, rudeness, random unprovoked singing or
humming or any other distracting noise for no particular reason, all of these things really shouldn't be happening and I
encourage you to work on cutting out any bad habits you may have in a VC. I'm not saying let's fully sterilize VC's of any
and all character and use them exclusively for direct conversations but y'know, like... a bit cleaner going forward? Thanks.

That should be all for this notice, remember to easy it take
