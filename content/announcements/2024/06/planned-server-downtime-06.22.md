Hai folks. Just an announcement about planned all server downtime later this month while I move about 1000 miles to the west.
Server's gonna be taking a road trip and hence offline for the duration of said move.

**Downtime Start:** Saturday, June 22, 2024 9:00 AM EDT  
**Expected Downtime End:** Monday, June 24, 2024 12:00 PM EDT  
(Note: Times are rough approximates)

There's a possibility the server will be back online on Sunday instead of Monday but that depends on how early we arrive at the new place + unpack + set up the server/internet equipment 

That's all, folks o/
