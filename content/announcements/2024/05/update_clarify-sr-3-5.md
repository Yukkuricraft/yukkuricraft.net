excerpt: Updates to clarification on Server Rule 3 and 5
---

SO, after a couple days of further discussion, multiple voting phases, and
reaching a unanimous agreement, we have finally decided where to settle Server
Rule 3's enforcement on Litematica. Let's lay it out one last time and that will
be the end of this discussion.

The official policy is now

- Survival will allow EasyPlace, but **NOT** Printer. Anything that performs
  actions **outside of your crosshair** is considered cheating and will be
  punished in Survival. Yes, this even applies to Elders.
- Creative will allow the usage of both as there's no advantage gained there,
  except in the case of niche scenarios like a building contest where the usage
  of either will result in punishment.

While we understand the outcry in favor of making massive builds more
accessible, you guys really need to understand that a line has to be drawn in
the sand somewhere. EasyPlace can be replicated by having godlike dexterity, all
it does is switch the block you're holding and let you place blocks really fast.
Printer, on the other hand, places blocks you aren't even _looking_ at. We have
to draw the line at cheating and Printer is definitely, by all means, cheating.
Cheating at its most basic fundamental core is "Gaining an unfair advantage
against other players." A vanilla client can't recreate Printer, there is no
legitimate way to recreate something like placing blocks outside of your
crosshair. There is a really fat line between _convenience_ and _cheating._ (God
I said that word alot but gotta get the point across
<:AliceSad:710727021709361162>)

If you're still bummed out about this policy, please ask about some of our
historical big-build gurus like Tony or Aka who never had these tools. It'll be
quite the humbling experience. That should be all for now, take it easy

_P.S. - Like I said at the start, this is the end of the discussion. Please do
not further strongarm, fearmonger, or otherwise try to harass staff or fellow
community members on the matter._

One last thing, Dan wrote us a really nice breakdown of what we would consider
cheating in various fields. Please use it as reference material to better
understand what would be banned going forward;

Acceptable clientside mods are purely cosmetic, performance-related or limited
to simplifying actions that can be performed in the vanilla game. Examples:
Sodium, shader packs, minimaps, waypoints, inventory management, HUDs and
overlays, Litematica's hologram and EasyPlace functionalities.

Prohibited clientside mods allow players to interact with the world (blocks,
entities and other players) in a way that is normally impossible in the vanilla
game or proves to be an advantage over people not using them. Including, but not
limited to, the following examples:

- Seeing through solid blocks (i.e. X-ray, FreeCam, invisible block resource
  packs),
- Attacking or using items or blocks outside of your direct line of view (i.e.
  Killaura, Litematica Printer),
- Automating player actions (i.e. Baritone, movement/interaction macros,
  anti-AFK measures),
- Exploiting game mechanics and glitches for an unfair advantage (i.e. any kind
  of item duper, bypassing server plugin limitations, flyspeed modifiers),
- Harming the server's performance (i.e. chunk loaders, entity spamming)
