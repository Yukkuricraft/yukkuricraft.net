Hello everyone! We have a couple of things to announce for you all today. First
and foremost, the server has officially updated to 1.16.5; that's the best
version to join from for now. However, the server also supports versions from
1.14 all the way to 1.17!

Secondly, we are proud to announce that **Gensokyo v3 is officially open for the
public!** Feel free to come by and take a look! Please keep in mind, however,
that this is an extremely early version of Gensokyo, and everything is subject
to any type of change. All the warp names use the word neo at the start.

Last, and certainly not least, the NPC Kagome vendors in our survival world have
been updated with a couple of fresh faces. Feel free to stop by to say hi! The
Nether dimension will be wiped and regenerated in about a week's time to allow
for pre-established players to get any last-minute vacating done.

This update has been a long time coming, and we're all so excited to be able to
share it with you! Thanks for reading, have fun, and as always, Take it easy~
