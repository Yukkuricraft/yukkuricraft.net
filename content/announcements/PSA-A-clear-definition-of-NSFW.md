  As with many changes from our old ways, here's a better explanation of what is
  and isn't acceptable outside of NSFW areas.

Hey there guys, yet another big-block PSA for you all. This time we're
addressing the rather hazy definitions of NSFW around the server. _(You are
going to see "NSFW" a lot lmao.)_ With our recent minor-conscious mentality, a
lot of things that were once acceptable are becoming less so. YC was once very
crass and lewd, openly sexual even down to how we advertised ourselves. Since we
kinda take the whole "PG-13" thing more seriously these days, it'd be best if we
more clearly defined _what_ is too far and what isn't.

First up, let's address imagery. Pictures and what-not posted were pretty up for
debate and remain so, as something that _could_ be NSFW depends on who you're
asking. However, we try to lean towards "would you show this to a kid?" **_Ecchi
images will most likely be safer posted in the NSFW room_** and we'll try to
more actively poke users so that they understand where the line is. Don't worry,
we're not opening with hammers swinging. Some skin is fine, but if it's clearly
meant to arouse you, don't put it in the _SFW_ channel.

Secondly comes the issue of behavior, this being conversations and what-not.
Obviously, we still do not allow Ero-RP in the server, but some people like to
border this. We're completely fine with a lewd joke, _buuuuut_ there is a line
and when you start to end up on r/creepyasterisks, you're over that line. **_For
behavior, try to steer from excessively NSFW topics._** If you wanna talk about
something a bit adult-level that's fine, but if the topic is vulgar, perhaps go
to DM's or NSFW. We respect our minors but we also kinda respect US law, where
YC is hosted

Overall, just please try to be mindful of the minors in our server. We're going
to start cracking down a bit on offenders, both for your safety and ours. The
law is very serious on this shit and we're not willing to play around with that.
If you're concerned or curious if something is too far, feel free to ask a staff
member first! That should be all, take it easy everyone~!
