Hi everyone, just a short post this time.

At the start of this year, we announced the new Staff Trainee program. This
would give potential new staff members a trial run of sorts to get a feel for
how they would handle being a staff member. I am happy to say that the program
has ended for now, with excellent results. We have 5 new staff members to
welcome. Please welcome Mori, Ice and Sei as mediators, and Nick and Benji as
builders.

This post should probably have been 3 posts, spread along the period as
individual trainee cycles concluded, but it seems we forgot. Let's hope it goes
better next time.
