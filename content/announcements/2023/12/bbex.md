Hey everyone,  
Some of you may remember when we recorded the Kappa Village Teaser back in October that we were delving into something that would aid positioning the server in the Touhou community as a whole. Well, we can finally lift the curtain and tell you what it is all about:

Yukkuricraft will have a feature presentation in the 16th Edition of Bunbunmaru Extra! âœ¨

Be sure to tune in to the BBEX Direct where you will see a presentation of the YC community as well as the World Premiere of the Kappa Village Teaser at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdWnOjDdGF4. You can also find an article we've written for their magazine in the description of the video. While you're at it, consider dropping the Paradise of Boundaries crew a follow on their Twitter at https://twitter.com/POfBoundaries.  
*Yukkuri shiteite ne~*
