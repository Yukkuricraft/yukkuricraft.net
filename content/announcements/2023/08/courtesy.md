excerpt: A small PSA to address the cornerstone of our community.

Hey everyone, just stopping by with another PSA to reflect on **the**
cornerstone of YC; Courtesy.

It's our first rule and while the rules are currently under an internal rework
(spoiler alert,) it remains GR1 as it's the core quality of our community.
Courtesy is more than simple kindness, it's offering a branch to understand one
another, it's considering others around you instead of just yourself, it's those
little steps you take to be part of the community rather than see yourself as
its center.

As for why I'm bringing this up and emphasizing it, we had a ban today against a
user that openly admitted to ban evasion. While this is more than enough to make
temporary bans permanent and permanent bans that much harder to appeal, what
really did them in was taking pride in what got them banned in the first place;
Violating GR1. They distressed another user to the point of them having a
meltdown.

While we're very forgiving as a staff team for mistakes, behavior like this is
your any% strategy for nailing a Permanent Non-Appealable ban across all of our
platforms. Be nice to one another, we don't save a seat for people like this.
That should be all, take it easy!  
(wow an actually short PSA for once lol)

*P.S. - No, "mentle" issues do not absolve you of responsibility for shitty
behavior. An asshole is an asshole no matter whose cheeks its sitting between.*  
*P.S.S. - If you know who got banned, I left their name out of this for a reason.*
