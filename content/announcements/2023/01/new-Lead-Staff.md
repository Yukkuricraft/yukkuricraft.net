Hey everyone! Happy new years!

Yeah that's it. Just a short little- nah I'm pulling your leg, we do have a
small announcement to ring in the new year; We're bringing Leads back! Please
congratulate the new Lead Mediator Mori and the new Lead Builders Redleaf and
qscgukp!

Some of you may remember these roles from way back when. We've finally decided 
to bring them back and to catch the rest of you up to speed, a Lead staff
member is the head of their division. They're appointed to help keep their team
organized and help admins out in maintaining the staff body while still
retaining their original duties.

It's short but hey, let's not stretch every message out to the character limit.
Let's have a great 2023 together, take it easy!
