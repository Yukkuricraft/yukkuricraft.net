Hihi, this is Ice~

Here's an announcement I didn't think I'd be making.

Having spent 4 years on this server, doing Survival, anniversary events, and
generally chilling out with people, I think it's been a good 4 years spent! I'll
go even further - YC has been one of the most supportive communities that I've
ever been in, and I couldn't ask for more.

Yet, life is catching up with me, and now I've been a bit busy. And that's why
you haven't seen me around much anymore. Moreover, not being around, not knowing
people... makes it pretty hard to understand and keep up with the community,
which therefore makes it tricky to do staff work...

As such, I've decided to step down from being staff. No hard feelings, though!
I'll still come back when all is said and done. In the meantime, keep on
dancin', keep on singin', let this place be home to more people in the future,
just as it was to me =w=
