  We changed our old Discord rules because they didn't give staff any means to 
  maintain a good vc environment. These new rules should give the community a 
  clear standard to follow and staff the ability to handle troublemakers.

Heya everyone!

It's been a long time coming, but we're finally getting around to the VC wild
west of Yukkuricraft. The current environment definitely hearkens back to the
Mumble days. Unfortunately, that uncontrolled environment doesn't keep up with
our modern standards and we don't really have the means to do much about it
as-is. The biggest problem is a lack of rules to maintain the voice channels, as
you know our Discord ruleset only has two rules.

Well, we're changing it to five proper rules now. These should address common
problems in VC and give staff the ability to smooth things out. This, of course,
puts a higher standard on our staff to follow the rules themselves, so
understand if we ourselves might slip up early on. Change always needs
adjustment and we're not gonna come out the gate hammers ready lmao. The old DR1
is removed outright and replaced with four new rules that cover actual issues,
while the old DR2 is now just DR5.

Review the new rules and keep 'em in mind going forward, we'll understand if
there's a hiccup but after a while everyone's expected to follow suit. Many of
you have been asking for VC changes and these rules are the first step towards
'em. That's about all for now, take it easy~
