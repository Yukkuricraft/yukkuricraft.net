Hi y'all. Just announcing planned downtime on Saturday, January 8th 2022. Downtime is expected to be roughly between 12pm until 6pm ET (GMT -05:00). However this is a rough estimate and subject to change.

I'm physically moving out of the apartment and into the new house during this so the server will be taking a short roadtrip.

At the same time I'll be overhauling the network infrastructure with some new Ubiquiti gear so get friggin hyped for some 10Gb fiber connections between rack components :hype:

Anyway, more news to come on the upgrades but this post is just for announcing downtime.

Happy holidays, everyone!
