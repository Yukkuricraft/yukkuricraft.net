excerpt: ISP is experiencing widespread outage affecting our server
---
Optimum is a piece of crap and is experiencing widespread outages in the Northeastern US.

Unfortunately this means our server is out of commission until the upstream ISP issues are resolved.

We will post another short announcement when the issue has been resolved.

P.S. Unfortunately our Discord server's Miko bot also runs on the same server and thus will also be out of commission until ISP issues are fixed.
