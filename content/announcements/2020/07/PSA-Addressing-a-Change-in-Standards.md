excerpt:
  Our recent internal workings amongst Staff have raised our standards, both for
  ourselves and for the community.

After a recent incident, it's come to my attention that the community was never
properly informed or given a heads-up about something, so here's a PSA to do so;

As some of you know, staff have underwent massive internal changes for a while
now. This included a large amount of members retiring, rules being completely
overhauled, ranks being cleaned up (Mediator/Builder finally have equal perms,
Lead titles actually do something, etc.) One thing that never got clarified is
these changes in standards and quality are not staff-exclusive. This also
applies to the community.

What I mean with that is, we're not just expecting ourselves to do better; you
guys also need to keep up. Most of you do so already, but there are some cases
of users that are entirely too comfortable and don't seem to fully understand
that YC now is **_not_** YC five years ago. We've changed, we expect the same
change from those who reside here. No beef towards you guys, this is all recent
work and it's honestly our bad for not sharing this heads-up earlier.
Sorrymasen.

We're not going to purge the server of any and all fun and make it squeaky clean
to appeal to visitors, but we have been (and will continue to) crack down on the
notably louder cases. This doesn't mean if you so much as even think about us
wrong, we'll kick your door down, but if your name keeps popping up because
you're pissing every other person off, we will investigate and intervene where
appropiate.

So, if it comes down to it that staff have to come and issue a warning or worse,
please don't go feral against us. This isn't a private skype group of a buncha
horny teens giggling over the fact we have Youmu porn as an advertisement. Work
with us so we can reach that sacred middle ground of keeping true to our
identity without closing ourselves off from the world, please. Re-read our rules
if need be, they're actual _rules_ now. That should be about it, sorry for yet
another big-block PSA lul. Take it easy~

**TL;DR** - _YC has underwent huge changes regarding quality and standards
lately, but it seems we never told the community about this. It means that our
bar for what's acceptable behavior has been raised, so please work with us if we
have to intervene on what was previously acceptable._
