## YukkuriCraft Paintball

Want to take a break from exploring Gensokyo, building, or surviving? Want to
duel someone on some battlements or have a full out battle? Want to just destroy
someone by throwing a snowball at them at high speeds? Or maybe you wish to see
what fun minigame plugins YC has to offer. Well, come check out Paintball!

Yukkuricraft uses the Paintball minigame plugin by blablubbabc, which you can
find here:
[https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintball_pure_war/](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintball_pure_war/).
This plugin lets players join a lobby where two or more players can face off
against each other in a fun modified snowball fight in a variety of different
arenas.

### How to Play

Simply typing the command `/pb join` will send you to the lobby of the paintball
world. It will ask that you clear your inventory before joining to avoid any
potential inventory issues. We recommend you do this in a creative world to
clear it faster.

Once at least two players are in the lobby simultaneously, the timer for the
next round will start. The chat will display a list of 4 random arenas that all
the players can vote for by typing `/pb vote #`. You can find other Paintball
related commands by simply typing `/pb`.

When in a match, you will start with 50 snowballs that make a player lose a life
when hit. Each player will normally have five lives, and the team with the most
players remaining at the end will win the round.

Players are either put on a blue team or a red team. Players can also join a
spectator team with `/pb spec` Doing this puts you in a neutral yellow team, and
we ask that you donâ€™t get in the way of the fights too much.

### Ranking and Shop

The plugin has a ranking system based on points earned in matches. Points will
increase your rank as you gain them, which grants access to new items and
weapons you can purchase with the shop in each match. You can access the shop
with the book from your inventory and spend cash, which you earn from killing
opponents.

### Arena Maps

We use a variety of Touhou locations from our Gensokyo 2 map. Most customized
for the experience of the minigame. Players have also created and submitted
their own maps for the minigame as well.

If you would like to make a map for the paintball plugin, please notify staff
and ask what is required. Generally, a balanced map with a spot for two teams to
spawn in is the minimum threshold.
