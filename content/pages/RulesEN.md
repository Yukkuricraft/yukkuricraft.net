## Rules

_Rules are accessible in-game through /rules_

_If you have been previously banned, you can appeal your ban
[here](https://forms.gle/gwFiECrDKNiJwLzH8)._

### GENERAL RULE-SET[GR]

Rules that apply across all of Yukkuricraft

1. **Be courteous and respectful**

   Keep an open mind on the server and respect that others may see things
   differently to you. Do not engage in toxic behavior. In this server, toxicity
   is defined as intentional actions of a non-humorous nature aimed at causing
   distress or emotional/social harm towards others. Continuing toxic behavior
   will lead to proper punishment.

   In addition, continuous aggravating/annoying behavior directed towards a
   significant part of the server, that stretches or comes close to breaking
   server rules, will be treated as toxic behavior.

2. **Respect staff**

   Staff members volunteer their time in order to support the server. Please
   give staff members the same courtesy and respect you offer towards others
   both online and offline, and remember that they attempt to consider all
   issues and disputes from as objective a viewpoint as possible. Staff members
   have the final say on most server matters.

3. **Do not create or share R18 content outside of designated spaces**

   YC's minimum age limit is 13, so be aware when minors are present.
   Furthermore, ero-rp is strictly forbidden due to risks of activity with
   minors, which is against U.S. law.

4) **Do not ask for promotions**

   Promotions to staff are administered as per the server's requirement. The
   highest non-staff rank attainable is Elder, which is obtained by being a
   continuing positive contributor to the server's social development. While
   asking for information or offering to help is fine, demanding a promotion
   will reflect poorly on your character.

5) **No account fraud/Ban evasion**

   Any attempts at ban evasion, account stealing/hijacking, or otherwise
   impersonating another community member for personal gain or any other reason
   will result in a permanent ban.

6) **No Soliciting**

   Unwarranted solicitations, attempts at spam, or inappropriate
   self-advertisements are not allowed. Aggressively or constantly nagging people
   about something you want them to do or join will not be tolerated. This rule
   is more strict on those not involved with the community, so spacing your
   advertisements out will not keep you clear of violating this rule if it's the
   only thing you do with us.

7) **SlOw RiDe TaKe It EaSy**

   At the end of the day, we're all just here to enjoy ourselves. The rules,
   while not concrete and are subject to change or working around if necessary,
   are simply put here to protect the good people and keep out the bad. So
   please, remember to have fun and take it easy.

### SERVER RULE-SET[SR]

Rules that apply mostly to the Minecraft server.

1. **Do not grief**

   Griefing or stealing of items is strictly prohibited, aside from consensual
   activity with friends.

2. **Do not PvP**

   Unwarranted attacks against non-consenting players is forbidden. Dueling or
   ambushing your friends is fine, but hunting strangers and other
   non-consensual PvP is not.

3. **Do not cheat**

   Do not use any software or exploits that may result in you gaining an unfair
   advantage over other players. Minimaps and waypoints, however, are permitted
   so long as the user does not abuse them.

4. **Be mindful when building**

   Builds that conflict with the existing environment, or are obviously
   low-effort, will be removed where appropriate.

5. **Don't abuse events and resources**

   Intentionally manipulating or exploiting server events and resources to gain
   material and items is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to the likes
   of massive farms, bots, and/or exploiting event areas for drops.

#### RemiCare

The RemiCare Act is an active power provided to the community that allows them
to claim abandoned builds in the survival world.

If a user has not logged on in over 90 days, their builds become viable for
Remicare. You can request staff to investigate the build and confirm the user
has been inactive for the timeframe, then give ownership of the build to you.
Logging in exclusively to avoid Remicare will not be counted. Elders and up are
entirely immune to Remicare. If a user below Elder rank suspects they will be
gone for longer than the 90 day period, they can inform staff and they will be
protected for the estimated time period. These protections can be overridden
under specific circumstances. Remicare is not guaranteed under any
circumstances. This power is NOT to be abused, it is for situational uses only.
Users attempting to exploit this system for loot by seeking out abandoned builds
and/or nagging staff for Remicare will be denied and potentially punished.

### DISCORD RULE-SET[DR]

Rules that apply mostly to the Discord server

1. **Share the Spotlight**

   Be courteous when talking to one another in the voice chats; everyone has a
   right to speak their opinions. Both excessive hogging of the room or constant
   interruptions will not be tolerated.

2. **Be wary of the room's overall volume**

   Unnecessary noises such as yelling or background disruptions that do not
   contribute to the conversation should be kept to a minimum. Offenders will be told
   to stop and potentially muted.

3. **Do not misuse purpose-specific voice channels**

   Chatter should be kept relevant to the current voice channel's purpose. For example,
   if you are in a *Game Room*, then the conversations should probably pertain
   to the current game of choice rather than more general topics.

4. **Keep things relevant to the ongoing topic**

   Don't suddenly drop in and derail an ongoing discussion. Be respectful of
   others if they're already mid-discussion.

5. **No NSFW without consent**

   If all members of a voice room with a temporary text channel consent to viewing
   NSFW material, NSFW material can be posted. However once a new member joins
   the room, the process must be repeated. NSFW anywhere else, apart from NSFW
   channels, is prohibited.

### Closing notes

Remember that communication is vital to a healthy community. Most problems can
be easily resolved by talking it out, rather than starting drama or trying to
get someone banned over nothing. Staff are here to help, not be contracted
hit-men for whomever you currently dislike. Treat your fellow member with the
same respect you'd like for yourself and remember to take it easy.
