The first line here tells you how many homes you can have in total, you can also get this information from the \`/home limit\` command. On the next line is a button create a new home. You just have to replace \`<homeName>\` with the desired name.

Next are the home list itself, in addition to buttons for teleporting to the home, moving it, inviting someone to it (more on invites later), bringing up residents interface (more on residents later), and finally a button to delete the home.
