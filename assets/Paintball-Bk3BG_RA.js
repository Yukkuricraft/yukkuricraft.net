Want to duel someone on some battlements or have a full out battle? Want to just destroy someone by throwing a snowball at them at high speeds? Or maybe you wish to see what fun minigame plugins YC has to offer. Well, come check out Paintball!</p><p>Yukkuricraft uses the Paintball minigame plugin by blablubbabc, which you can find here: <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintball_pure_war/">https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paintball_pure_war/</a>. This plugin lets players join a lobby where two or more players can face off against each other in a fun modified snowball fight in a variety of different arenas.</p><h3 id="how-to-play" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> How to Play</h3><p>Simply typing the command <code>/pb join</code> will send you to the lobby of the paintball world. It will ask that you clear your inventory before joining to avoid any potential inventory issues. We recommend you do this in a creative world to clear it faster.</p><p>Once at least two players are in the lobby simultaneously, the timer for the next round will start. The chat will display a list of 4 random arenas that all the players can vote for by typing <code>/pb vote #</code>. You can find other Paintball related commands by simply typing <code>/pb</code>.</p><p>When in a match, you will start with 50 snowballs that make a player lose a life when hit. Each player will normally have five lives, and the team with the most players remaining at the end will win the round.</p><p>Players are either put on a blue team or a red team. Players can also join a spectator team with <code>/pb spec</code> Doing this puts you in a neutral yellow team, and we ask that you donâ€™t get in the way of the fights too much.</p><h3 id="ranking-and-shop" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ranking-and-shop" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> Ranking and Shop</h3><p>The plugin has a ranking system based on points earned in matches. Points will increase your rank as you gain them, which grants access to new items and weapons you can purchase with the shop in each match. You can access the shop with the book from your inventory and spend cash, which you earn from killing opponents.</p><h4 id="shop-items" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shop-items" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> Shop items</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Quantity</th><th>Item</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10x</td><td>Balls</td><td>10$</td></tr><tr><td>50x</td><td>Balls</td><td>50$</td></tr><tr><td>100x</td><td>Balls</td><td>100$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Grendade Mark 2</td><td>15$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Grenade</td><td>20$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Concussion Nade</td><td>15$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Flashbang</td><td>15$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Rocket Launcher</td><td>20$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Mine</td><td>10$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Pumpgun</td><td>20$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Speed</td><td>20$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Shotgun</td><td>20$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Airstrike</td><td>80$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Orbitalstrike</td><td>80$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Turret</td><td>180$</td></tr><tr><td>1x</td><td>Sniper</td><td>80$</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="paintball-ranks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#paintball-ranks" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> Paintball Ranks</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Name</th><th>Required points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Fairy</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>(9)</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Human</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Magician</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Ghost</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Vampire</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Lunarian</td><td>1500</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Youkai Exterminator</td><td>2750</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>???</td><td>5000</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Gap Youkai</td><td>7500</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>Hakurei Miko</td><td>15000</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="arena-maps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#arena-maps" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> Arena Maps</h3><p>We use a variety of Touhou locations from our Gensokyo 2 map. Most customized for the experience of the minigame.

Generally, a balanced map with a spot for two teams to spawn in is the minimum threshold.</p>',17);function a(t,i){return d}const r={render:a};r.__hmrId="/home/runner/work/yukkuricraft.net/yukkuricraft.net/content/pages/Paintball.md";const s=t=>({components:t,render:a});export{r as VueComponent,s as VueComponentWith,o as attributes};
