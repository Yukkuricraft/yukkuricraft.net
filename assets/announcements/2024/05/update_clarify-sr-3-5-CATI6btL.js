Let’s lay it out one last time and that will be the end of this discussion.</p><p>The official policy is now</p><ul><li>Survival will allow EasyPlace, but <strong>NOT</strong> Printer. Anything that performs actions <strong>outside of your crosshair</strong> is considered cheating and will be punished in Survival. Yes, this even applies to Elders.</li><li>Creative will allow the usage of both as there’s no advantage gained there, except in the case of niche scenarios like a building contest where the usage of either will result in punishment.</li></ul><p>While we understand the outcry in favor of making massive builds more accessible, you guys really need to understand that a line has to be drawn in the sand somewhere. EasyPlace can be replicated by having godlike dexterity, all it does is switch the block you’re holding and let you place blocks really fast. Printer, on the other hand, places blocks you aren’t even <em>looking</em> at. We have to draw the line at cheating and Printer is definitely, by all means, cheating. Cheating at its most basic fundamental core is “Gaining an unfair advantage against other players.” A vanilla client can’t recreate Printer, there is no legitimate way to recreate something like placing blocks outside of your crosshair. There is a really fat line between <em>convenience</em> and <em>cheating.</em> (God I said that word alot but gotta get the point across &lt;:AliceSad:710727021709361162&gt;)</p><p>If you’re still bummed out about this policy, please ask about some of our historical big-build gurus like Tony or Aka who never had these tools. It’ll be quite the humbling experience. That should be all for now, take it easy &lt;:RumiaSleep:619028578725789706&gt;</p><p><em>P.S. - Like I said at the start, this is the end of the discussion. Please do not further strongarm, fearmonger, or otherwise try to harass staff or fellow community members on the matter.</em></p><p>One last thing, Dan wrote us a really nice breakdown of what we would consider cheating in various fields. Please use it as reference material to better understand what would be banned going forward;</p><p>Acceptable clientside mods are purely cosmetic, performance-related or limited to simplifying actions that can be performed in the vanilla game. Examples: Sodium, shader packs, minimaps, waypoints, inventory management, HUDs and overlays, Litematica’s hologram and EasyPlace functionalities.</p><p>Prohibited clientside mods allow players to interact with the world (blocks, entities and other players) in a way that is normally impossible in the vanilla game or proves to be an advantage over people not using them. Including, but not limited to, the following examples:</p><ul><li>Seeing through solid blocks (i.e. X-ray, FreeCam, invisible block resource packs),</li><li>Attacking or using items or blocks outside of your direct line of view (i.e. Killaura, Litematica Printer),</li><li>Automating player actions (i.e. Baritone, movement/interaction macros, anti-AFK measures),</li><li>Exploiting game mechanics and glitches for an unfair advantage (i.e. any kind of item duper, bypassing server plugin limitations, flyspeed modifiers),</li><li>Harming the server’s performance (i.e. chunk loaders, entity spamming)</li></ul>",10);function t(e,o){return a}const n={render:t};n.__hmrId="/home/runner/work/yukkuricraft.net/yukkuricraft.net/content/announcements/2024/05/update_clarify-sr-3-5.md";const l=e=>({components:e,render:t});export{n as VueComponent,l as VueComponentWith,s as attributes};
