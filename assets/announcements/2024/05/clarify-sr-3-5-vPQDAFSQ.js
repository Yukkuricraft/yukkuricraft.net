This is to more clearly define a few things that <em>aren’t allowed</em> and <em>haven’t been allowed</em> but weren’t properly listed in them, leading to a grey area where it wasn’t clear with neither staff nor community.</p><p><s>Server Rule 3 <code>[Do not cheat.]</code> will soon explicitly mention building blueprint mods such as Litematica. These mods are only allowed for visual reference, any form of building aid is disallowed except in the case of Staff approved map art and Elders whom we trust will not <em>abuse</em> it (and will be punished if they do.)</s> See next announcement for an update.</p><p>Server Rule 5 <code>[Do not abuse events and resources.]</code> will now explicitly state that both alt-farming and chunkloaders are strictly forbidden. Alt-farming is using multiple accounts simultaneously with at least one of them idled at a farm that generates resources, please ask staff if you would like a more detailed explanation or to answer if something is allowed with alts. Chunkloaders of <strong>any</strong> design are not permitted on the <strong>vanilla</strong> server, however are fine on BMT as the modpack has native chunkloaders in it. Note that <em>disabled, deactivated, or otherwise non-functioning</em> Chunkloaders are still in violation.</p><p>Once again, ask staff if you have any questions about these rule changes or about any rules in general. Most of our work is done case by case so it wouldn’t hurt to get ahead of us if you think you or someone could be potentially violating the rules without knowing. That should be all, take it easy!</p><p><em>P.S. - We will not retroactively punish anyone even though these rules were already against these things. Again, it wasn’t clearly defined and we can’t fault you for not knowing word-of-mouth policy.</em> <em>P.S.S. - The rules will have their writing updated within a couple days so until then, you’ll still see the current wording. This will not excuse rule violations that take place between this announcement and the wording update.</em></p>",6);function t(e,i){return o}const a={render:t};a.__hmrId="/home/runner/work/yukkuricraft.net/yukkuricraft.net/content/announcements/2024/05/clarify-sr-3-5.md";const l=e=>({components:e,render:t});export{a as VueComponent,l as VueComponentWith,s as attributes};
