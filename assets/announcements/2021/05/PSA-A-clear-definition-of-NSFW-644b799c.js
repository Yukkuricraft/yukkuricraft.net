This time we’re addressing the rather hazy definitions of NSFW around the server. <em>(You are going to see “NSFW” a lot lmao.)</em> With our recent minor-conscious mentality, a lot of things that were once acceptable are becoming less so. YC was once very crass and lewd, openly sexual even down to how we advertised ourselves. Since we kinda take the whole “PG-13” thing more seriously these days, it’d be best if we more clearly defined <em>what</em> is too far and what isn’t.</p><p>First up, let’s address imagery. Pictures and what-not posted were pretty up for debate and remain so, as something that <em>could</em> be NSFW depends on who you’re asking. However, we try to lean towards “would you show this to a kid?” <strong><em>Ecchi images will most likely be safer posted in the NSFW room</em></strong> and we’ll try to more actively poke users so that they understand where the line is. Don’t worry, we’re not opening with hammers swinging. Some skin is fine, but if it’s clearly meant to arouse you, don’t put it in the <em>SFW</em> channel.</p><p>Secondly comes the issue of behavior, this being conversations and what-not. Obviously, we still do not allow Ero-RP in the server, but some people like to border this. We’re completely fine with a lewd joke, <em>buuuuut</em> there is a line and when you start to end up on r/creepyasterisks, you’re over that line. <strong><em>For behavior, try to steer from excessively NSFW topics.</em></strong> If you wanna talk about something a bit adult-level that’s fine, but if the topic is vulgar, perhaps go to DM’s or NSFW. We respect our minors but we also kinda respect US law, where YC is hosted</p><p>Overall, just please try to be mindful of the minors in our server. We’re going to start cracking down a bit on offenders, both for your safety and ours. The law is very serious on this shit and we’re not willing to play around with that. If you’re concerned or curious if something is too far, feel free to ask a staff member first! That should be all, take it easy everyone~!</p>",4);function t(e,n){return r}const s={render:t};s.__hmrId="/home/runner/work/yukkuricraft.net/yukkuricraft.net/content/announcements/2021/05/PSA-A-clear-definition-of-NSFW.md";const l=e=>({components:e,render:t});export{s as VueComponent,l as VueComponentWith,a as attributes};
