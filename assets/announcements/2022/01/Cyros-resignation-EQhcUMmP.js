It’s most likely not a date that means anything to you guys, but it is a date that is important to me. It is the day I joined Yukkuricraft. What started as a means to find a video I once saw turned into a journey I never expected to be a part of. I’ve been a part of this community for almost nine years. That’s more than double the age of some of our community members here. And while it’s been a long journey, it is time that I throw in the towel and retire, but do not worry. I’ll still be around.",-1)),t[1]||(t[1]=e("p",null,"When I joined Yukkuricraft, the only thing that was on my mind was that I wanted to help as much as I could, because I joined with a huge passion for both Minecraft and Touhou. The two things that culminated together into something special to me. While this community didn’t reach the vision I had hoped, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth it. I’ve made so many new friends. I’ve grown as a Minecraft creator. I’ve helped in this community much more than I ever thought I would be able to. What started as wanting to help got me a position as an administrator in the community. My only regret is that I didn’t make use of my ability when I was first promoted to the position, and my second time was after I tried recovering from burn out of this place.",-1)),t[2]||(t[2]=e("p",null,"Yukkuricraft is filled with lots of history, most of which I’ve experienced firsthand. I’ve been a part of some of the best moments, and also a part of the worst times, but it’s because of that history that we grow as a community. The drama that has happened in the past is not supposed to be something to look back at and regret. After all. What happened has happened, and we can’t change that. Instead, we should reflect on it and grow from it. This community has had its fair share of drama for far too long, and I’m glad we’ve moved on from it. If for some reason any of you have thoughts that me stepping down was not my decision and you start drama from that? Take a moment and realize that maybe you might be the problem. I’m sorry to say it like that, but I am stepping down in one of the most peaceful times of this community, and I hope it stays that way, for this is still my home. It’s your home too. It’s all of our home, and when it comes to a home, the family looks out for one another. Never forget that.",-1)),t[3]||(t[3]=e("p",null,"While this is not a goodbye, it is a sendoff. I have full confidence that the staff body will do fine without me. The recent Halloween Event is proof of that. Sure, the staff may seem distant at times, but they are always there for you. They will listen to you. For me, I plan to spend the rest of my time in this community peacefully and without a care in the world. You’ll still see me around. Even working on a Gensokyo build from time to time when the opportunity arises. With that, I hope you people continue to thrive and enjoy the rest of your time here as well. I’ll be around watching and enjoying my time here alongside you.
