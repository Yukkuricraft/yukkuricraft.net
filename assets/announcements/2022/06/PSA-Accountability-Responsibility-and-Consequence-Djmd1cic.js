I’ll circle back to these cases later, but I just want to make the point clear now; You are responsible for your own actions.

You can’t even blame age on this, if you’re old enough to meet our 13-or-over age requirement, you’re old enough to take responsibility for what you do here. If someone else is forcing your hand or pushing your limits, please come to staff instead of trying to resolve it yourself if you believe it will cause the issue to worsen.

If you’re caught faking a mental illness or making light of them, you will be punished accordingly. No exceptions on this one.
