`},n=o("<p><em><strong>This announcement is composed of two posts made a week apart from each other, they have been consolidated here for the sake of brevity.</strong></em></p><hr><p>Hey hey people, Tesh here. I come bearing actually big news this time and it’s not looking good for the short term but definitely looks great in the long term.<br><strong>We are here to officially announce the abolishment of NSFW in our server.</strong> I’ll get to the reason why in a second but first I want to lay down what this entails;</p><ul><li>The NSFW room on our Discord will be deleted along with the respective rank to gain access to it.</li><li>NSFW content will no longer be allowed in YC jurisdiction.</li><li>Content or discussion that begins to push too far into this territory will now be more harshly punished. Watch the risque jokes.</li></ul><p>While we haven’t had any issues yet with the NSFW room or its presence in this server, it <em>is</em> a major point of concern that our 18+ rank has no vetting process. While pondering what we could do to make things more secure for the server, it became clear that wasting resources and time on setting up a vetting process is pointless as simply having the room in our server hard-caps how much we can grow as a community. It locks us out of a lot of options and puts us at permanent, unnecessary risk, even if we checked your ID in person.</p><p>With this in mind, we have ultimately decided that it would be better for the health and safety of the server to axe the room outright, as well as crack down on NSFW as a whole. We’re a 13+ server, not an 18+ server, so we have plenty of minors present. You don’t need a PhD in statistics to understand the risk that alone puts us at. Locking off people below 18 cuts out a large audience that could appreciate the Gensokyo project and setting up a vetting process doesn’t address the concern of growth. No matter which way you look at the problem, this is the only solution that’s viable for us.</p><p>We will give the room one more week to ride out, give you time to save anything you like from it, before we nuke it entirely and instill our new policies. To be courteous, we’ll start at gentle nudges so we can all learn where the line in the sand has shifted to. If you really, <em>really</em> need your fix, you can literally look up nsfw servers on disboard. That should be all, take it easy~!</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - <em>We are removing the NSFW room and instilling new policies for NSFW content in a week. This is to make YC a safer place that can actually grow, since NSFW content heavily limits what doors are open to us and being a minor-friendly server puts us at risk no matter how much vetting we can do.</em></p><hr><p>Alright, the day has arrived and the change is now fully in effect. To reiterate, YukkuriCraft <strong>no longer</strong> tolerates NSFW content or behavior. Our rules have been updated to reflect this;</p><ul><li>General Rule 3 has been changed to outright reject NSFW content and behavior</li><li>Discord Rule 5 has been removed as it was redundant after this change and the condition it provided is no longer valid</li></ul><p>The NSFW Access role on Discord has also been removed to coincide with this. While this does mean minors are no longer as easy to detect, you frankly shouldn’t be acting in a way that’s compromising with minors present going forward. Staff are going to up their policies regarding raunchy behavior but we will take it easy starting out, then slowly ramp up as time passes just so nobody is taken completely off guard by the shift. We gotta figure out where the line in the sand is now.</p><p>(P.S. - Incase you haven’t read the updated GR3 entry, <em>cropped</em> or <em>censored</em> images will be treated as uncropped/uncensored. Don’t try to skirt around the rule.)<br> (P.S.S. - Staff do not always immediately respond to an infraction, we discuss most of our actions before executing them. If you get poked for something hours or even a day after it happens, that’s why.)</p>",13);function t(e,s){return n}const r={render:t};r.__hmrId="/home/runner/work/yukkuricraft.net/yukkuricraft.net/content/announcements/2023/06/no-nsfw.md";const h=e=>({components:e,render:t});export{r as VueComponent,h as VueComponentWith,i as attributes};
