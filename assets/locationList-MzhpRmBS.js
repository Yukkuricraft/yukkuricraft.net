sun never sets. This impressive city took a total of 5 months to complete, and upholds
the legacy of its predecessor by being a testament of determination and tenacity. The

from functional buildings and state parks, to residential complexes and modern facilities.
Two world wonders also call the city home; the Infinity Gate and Imperial Palace highlight

Nekomura is essentially an island village that sits to the East of Kagome, providing
shelter to its feline residents and fellow travelers. The island, believed to have aged
over a decade, was once said to be a colourless island that would wither away any sign of
life until recent rulership by a cat king. The town also holds pride into the overall
aesthetic of its nature, allowing cat or man made build to co-exist with its surrounding.
The residents are also capable of conversing in human language, paired with their
friendliness and endless curiousity.</p>

<p>Official township comes in two different tiers with their own requirements for
application. Here are the requirements needed for each:</p>
<p><strong>Town</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Must have 3 or more residents (alt accounts don’t count) living with their
own individual residences. Vacation-home scenarios will not be counted, the home
must be lived in and in use.</li>
<li>Must have a town hall (or town hall equivalent) and 2 more non-residential
buildings.</li>
<li>Must obey Server Rule 4 and pass an overall staff review.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>City</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Must have 6 or more residents. Same restrictions as towns.</li>
<li>Must have a city hall (or city hall equivalent) and 6 more non-residential
buildings (4 + the 2 buildings towns are expected to have).</li>
<li>Must obey Server Rule 4 and pass an overall staff review.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A definition/rule on non-residential buildings:</em><br>
Buildings are to be fully completed with interiors. Low-effort and empty buildings
will not qualify for assessment.<br>
Below are some non-exhaustive suggestions for non-residential buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community center</li>
<li>Tavern / Bar / Pub</li>
<li>Inn</li>
<li>Market</li>
<li>Guardhouse</li>
<li>Stables</li>
<li>Courthouse</li>
</ul>
<p>If a town owner believes their town qualifies, they may request an inspection from
the staff. Inspections are carried out by an admin and two other staff members.
Inspections are carried for both tiers separately. Should the initial town
inspection pass, the owner may request for a city inspection immediately after.</p>

<p><strong>Building Grants</strong><br>
A build grant is given in the form of a double chest containing various materials.

settlement, and serve to assist in further development.<br>
Grants contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 will consist of 9 stacks of blocks A, B, C, and D which are
