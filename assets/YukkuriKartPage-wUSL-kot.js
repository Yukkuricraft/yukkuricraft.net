Unlike our other minigame, Paintball, YukkuriKart is not (directly)
powered by plugins and does not operate by any strict game logic. How
you wish to race around our tracks is completely up to you!`,sublocations:{howto:{displayName:"How to Play",menuName:"How to Play",description:`YukkuriKart can be found by simply typing \`/warp yukkurikart\` on our
Minecraft server.  
From there, you will find yourself in the minigame's lobby where you
can brush up on the rules and access our numerous ice boat tracks.
If ever you wish to return to the lobby from the tracks, simply type
the warp command again.

As YukkuriKart doesn't use any plugins, this minigame instead
operates by honor rules. Players must agree amongst themselves to
any race rules (such as lap count, PVP, etc.). If multiple players
are hanging out at YukkuriKart, please be mindful of which tracks are
in use and try not to interrupt any in-progress races or time trials.  
Please consult the rule book at the lobby for more information on
how to play.`},submit:{displayName:"How to Submit Tracks",menuName:"Submit Tracks",description:`We're always willing to accept new race tracks into YukkuriKart.
If you have an ice boat track you'd like to submit or are currently

seeing your new track added to our roster in the server and on this
