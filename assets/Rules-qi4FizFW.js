Do not engage in toxic behavior. In this server, toxicity is defined as intentional actions of a non-humorous nature aimed at causing distress or emotional/social harm towards others. Continuing toxic behavior will lead to proper punishment.</p><p>In addition, continuous aggravating/annoying behavior directed towards a significant part of the server, that stretches or comes close to breaking server rules, will be treated as toxic behavior.</p></li><li><p><strong>Respect staff</strong></p><p>Staff members volunteer their time in order to support the server. Please give staff members the same courtesy and respect you offer towards others both online and offline, and remember that they attempt to consider all issues and disputes from as objective a viewpoint as possible. Staff members have the final say on most server matters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep things SFW (Safe for Work)</strong></p><p>YC’s minimum age limit is 13. As such, we do not condone NSFW content or behavior here. This includes your profile, if it’s cropped or censored we’re going to treat it as uncropped/uncensored.</p></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Do not ask for promotions</strong></p><p>Promotions to staff are administered as per the server’s requirement. The highest non-staff rank attainable is Sage, which is obtained by being a continuing positive contributor to the server’s social development. While asking for information or offering to help is fine, demanding a promotion will reflect poorly on your character.</p></li><li><p><strong>No account fraud/Ban evasion</strong></p><p>Any attempts at ban evasion, account stealing/hijacking, or otherwise impersonating another community member for personal gain or any other reason will result in a permanent ban.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Soliciting</strong></p><p>Unwarranted solicitations, attempts at spam, or inappropriate self-advertisements are not allowed. Aggressively or constantly nagging people about something you want them to do or join will not be tolerated. This rule is more strict on those not involved with the community, so spacing your advertisements out will not keep you clear of violating this rule if it’s the only thing you do with us.</p></li><li><p><strong>SlOw RiDe TaKe It EaSy</strong></p><p>At the end of the day, we’re all just here to enjoy ourselves. The rules, while not concrete and are subject to change or working around if necessary, are simply put here to protect the good people and keep out the bad. So please, remember to have fun and take it easy.</p></li></ol><h3 id="server-rule-set[sr]" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#server-rule-set[sr]" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> SERVER RULE-SET[SR]</h3><p>Rules that apply mostly to the Minecraft server.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Do not grief</strong></p><p>Griefing or stealing of items is strictly prohibited, aside from consensual activity with friends.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not PvP</strong></p><p>Unwarranted attacks against non-consenting players is forbidden. Dueling or ambushing your friends is fine, but hunting strangers and other non-consensual PvP is not.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not cheat</strong></p><p>Do not use any software or exploits that may result in you gaining an unfair advantage over other players. Minimaps and waypoints, however, are permitted so long as the user does not abuse them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be mindful when building</strong></p><p>Builds that conflict with the existing environment, or are obviously low-effort, will be removed where appropriate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t abuse events and resources</strong></p><p>Intentionally manipulating or exploiting server events and resources to gain material and items is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to the likes of massive farms, bots, and/or exploiting event areas for drops.</p></li></ol><h4 id="remicare" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#remicare" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> RemiCare</h4><p>The RemiCare Act is an active power provided to the community that allows them to claim abandoned builds in the survival world.</p><p>If a user has not logged on in over 90 days, their builds become viable for Remicare. You can request staff to investigate the build and confirm the user has been inactive for the timeframe, then give ownership of the build to you. Logging in exclusively to avoid Remicare will not be counted. Sages and up are entirely immune to Remicare. If a user below Sage rank suspects they will be gone for longer than the 90 day period, they can inform staff and they will be protected for the estimated time period. These protections can be overridden under specific circumstances. Remicare is not guaranteed under any circumstances. This power is NOT to be abused, it is for situational uses only. Users attempting to exploit this system for loot by seeking out abandoned builds and/or nagging staff for Remicare will be denied and potentially punished.</p><h3 id="discord-rule-set[dr]" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#discord-rule-set[dr]" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> DISCORD RULE-SET[DR]</h3><p>Rules that apply mostly to the Discord server</p><ol><li><p><strong>Share the Spotlight</strong></p><p>Be courteous when talking to one another in the voice chats; everyone has a right to speak their opinions. Both excessive hogging of the room or constant interruptions will not be tolerated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be wary of the room’s overall volume</strong></p><p>Unnecessary noises such as yelling or background disruptions that do not contribute to the conversation should be kept to a minimum. Offenders will be told to stop and potentially muted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not misuse purpose-specific voice channels</strong></p><p>Chatter should be kept relevant to the current voice channel’s purpose. For example, if you are in a <em>Game Room</em>, then the conversations should probably pertain to the current game of choice rather than more general topics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep things relevant to the ongoing topic</strong></p><p>Don’t suddenly drop in and derail an ongoing discussion. Be respectful of others if they’re already mid-discussion.</p></li></ol><h3 id="closing-notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#closing-notes" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-link" style="font-size:0.5em;"></i></a> Closing notes</h3><p>Remember that communication is vital to a healthy community. Most problems can be easily resolved by talking it out, rather than starting drama or trying to get someone banned over nothing. Staff are here to help, not be contracted hit-men for whomever you currently dislike. Treat your fellow member with the same respect you’d like for yourself and remember to take it easy.</p>',18))}const n={render:o};n.__hmrId="/home/runner/work/yukkuricraft.net/yukkuricraft.net/content/pages/Rules.md";const a=e=>({components:e,render:o});export{n as VueComponent,a as VueComponentWith,s as attributes};
