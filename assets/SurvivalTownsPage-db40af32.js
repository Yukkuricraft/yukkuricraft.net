Find it too boring not having neighbors?  
Our survival map has towns that range from close community neighborhoods
connected by a single road to massive cities with distinct cultures and styles.

Towns usually accept any and all community members to live in them.  
However, residential approval should only be done at the discretion of
the town owners unless they release exceptions and that our following town
policies are understood clearly:

1.	Town owners are responsible for informing players wanting to live in
    the town of any build regulations and should provide clear
    documentation of said regulations.
2.	Town owners may evict any offending residents in terms of said regulations.
    Exceptions to this right include failure to properly inform the resident
    of build regulations or unreasonable change of regulations.
3.	Under the Remicare policy, town owners can Remicare resident houses
    should the Remicare requirements be met.
4.	Players reserve the right and freedom to be residents in multiple towns
    and leave any town whenever they please unless this right is abused.`,sublocations:{application:{displayName:"Apply for Official Township",menuName:"Apply",description:`While it's unnecessary for building or running a town, we have an official
township registry for town owners to apply to.  
Being recognised as an official town grants several benefits to aid in
developing a town further (see [Benefits](#location-benefits) section for more).

Official township comes in two different tiers with their own requirements for
application. Here are the requirements needed for each:

**Town**  
1. Must have 3 or more residents (alt accounts don't count) living with their
own individual residences. Vacation-home scenarios will not be counted, the home
must be lived in and in use.
2. Must have a town hall (or town hall equivalent) and 2 more non-residential
buildings.
3. Must obey Server Rule 4 and pass an overall staff review.

**City**  
1. Must have 6 or more residents. Same restrictions as towns.
2. Must have a city hall (or city hall equivalent) and 6 more non-residential
buildings (4 + the 2 buildings towns are expected to have).
3. Must obey Server Rule 4 and pass an overall staff review.

*A definition/rule on non-residential buildings:*  
Buildings are to be fully completed with interiors. Low-effort and empty buildings
will not qualify for assessment.  
Below are some non-exhaustive suggestions for non-residential buildings:  
- Community center  
- Tavern / Bar / Pub  
- Inn  
- Market  
- Guardhouse  
- Stables  
- Courthouse  

If a town owner believes their town qualifies, they may request an inspection from
the staff. Inspections are carried out by an admin and two other staff members.
Inspections are carried for both tiers separately. Should the initial town
inspection pass, the owner may request for a city inspection immediately after.`},benefits:{displayName:"Official Town Benefits",menuName:"Benefits",description:`If successful in a staff review, officially recognised towns receive the following
benefits:  
- A [warp ship](#location-ships) connecting to Kagome Town (cities can also have warp ships connecting
to other official towns)
- A building grant (and one more for cities)
- A listing on this page! :D

**Building Grants**  
A build grant is given in the form of a double chest containing various materials.
These are awarded to the settlement owner for successfully being recognised as a
settlement, and serve to assist in further development.  
Grants contain the following:  
- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 will consist of 9 stacks of blocks A, B, C, and D which are
chosen by the owner from a list of materials ("Foundation blocks") allowed for grants.
- Row 5 will consist of 9 stacks of wooden logs, each stack chosen by the owner from
the six overworld wood types.
- Row 6 consists of 3 iron pickaxes, 3 iron axes, and 3 iron shovels, each enchanted
with Efficiency 5 and Unbreaking 3 to help with construction.

The following foundation blocks are allowed for grants:
- Dirt
- Cobblestone
- Sand/Red sand
- Gravel
- Diorite
- Andesite
- Granite
- Clay
- Deepslate`},ships:{displayName:"Warp Ships",menuName:"Ships",description:`Owners of officially-recognised towns can request a boat or airship at Kagome's
naval or airport docks. These ships are equipped with a provided command block,
allowing instantaneous teleportation between the two locations the ship is docked at.  
When requesting for a ship link to Kagome (or another town if connecting from a city),
the warp ship must meet the following requirements:

1. Ships must be at maximum 11 blocks wide, 25 blocks long, and 40 blocks tall. Ships
can be allowed to exceed the stated size requirements by a block if the said block is
a “non-contact” block with the dock or airport borders, such as a banner, open trapdoor,
or sign.
2. Ships must have a space for a command block with some activation method for it.
3. Ship design must be appropriate for its purpose.

Should the ship meet these requirements and the owner would like to request a ship
link, they should double-check with a staff member, and then build the ship at their
town/city dock (staff will not cover expenses for construction). Once done, they must
contact staff again. The ship will then be copied and pasted at Kagome's docks or
airport, and the proper commands implemented.`}}},towns:{displayName:"List of Towns",menuName:"Towns",description:`Below are a list of towns that have been officially recognised by our server's staff.

Rivaled only by the cities of the old, the Imperium's capital city
holds the title of the largest in survival and is widely recognized
as a gold standard of cityscape. Built steadily over a span of three months,
its population capacity knows no equal, while its state-funded services
such as underground rail lines and public farms prove worthy of the city's reputation.
It is, without doubt, an important cornerstone in the server's survival history.`,images:[{name:"towns_farms/towns/Praetoria1",image_taken_by:"TexasTony"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/Praetoria2",image_taken_by:"TexasTony"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/Praetoria3",image_taken_by:"TexasTony"}]},star_sail_island:{displayName:"Star Sail Island",menuName:"Star Sail Island",type:"town",builders:[{name:"HERO_Z",uuid:"fb10cb8d-5008-4143-b33b-caf14f68cf59"}],description:`- Type: Town

An island of color in a bright sea and a sanctuary for coral,
Star Sail Island has always been admired for its lively and peaceful atmosphere.
Located near a public Guardian farm, it is also well known as a convenient resting spot,
as it provides amenities such as underground rail lines and free food.
However, its most famous feature is its unique architecture,
as it maintains a delicate yet perfect balance of nature and development.`,images:[{name:"towns_farms/towns/StarSailIsland1",image_taken_by:"iBirB_"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/StarSailIsland2",image_taken_by:"iBirB_"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/StarSailIsland3",image_taken_by:"iBirB_"}]},masquerade:{displayName:"Masquerade",menuName:"Masquerade",type:"town",builders:[{name:"Seishishou",uuid:"53660814-7442-46d3-b887-5488272039be"}],description:`- Type: Town

Started from the renowned Poker Face Bookstore, foot traffic has attracted many youkai,
humans and Yukkuris from various parts to Masquerade. With the efforts of the overseeing
menreiki and those who came to stay, the area has developed gradually over the years,
from barren lands to houses and fields. The ever-changing town eventually became a beacon
for calmness and tranquility.`,images:[{name:"towns_farms/towns/Masquerade1",image_taken_by:"Seishishou"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/Masquerade2",image_taken_by:"Seishishou"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/Masquerade3",image_taken_by:"Seishishou"}]},flandern:{displayName:"Flandern",menuName:"Flandern",type:"town",builders:[{name:"Red_Flanders",uuid:"2f6484cb-003f-4337-ae74-2f3cc4ca1342"}],description:`- Type: Town

Flandern is a playful and organic town that 'takes it easy'. Whether they were drawn in by
its iconic pixelart or dragged in by veterans, many new players have found warm welcomes
on their first survival day here. Explorers can expect secrets, odd sights, Touhou-based
builds, silliness, and Yuyuko yukkuri eastereggs. Flandern's heart is the museum, which
is best known for showcasing the numerous maparts made in Survival.`,images:[{name:"towns_farms/towns/Flandern1",image_taken_by:"Red_Flanders"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/Flandern2",image_taken_by:"Red_Flanders"},{name:"towns_farms/towns/Flandern3",image_taken_by:"Red_Flanders"}]},barracuda_wharf:{displayName:"Barracuda Wharf",menuName:"Barracuda Wharf",type:"town",builders:[{name:"Yukibara",uuid:"6115a433-12e7-4fc4-84f4-9077d8d6ad4b"}],description:`- Type: Legacy Town

Originally started as a royal outpost for Coronian Kingdom,
presently the coastal town of Barracuda Wharf is a major crossroad in the
overall link of survival's many routes. To the northwest lies Tengu territory,
while the neighboring Praetorian imperial colony hosts the great southern rail line;
a vital link of the stations near scattered survival sprite monuments.
