      <h1>Help us build Gensokyo</h1>
      <p>We always need more hands to help us build Gensokyo. Here is a list of our ongoing projects.</p>
    </template>

    <h2>Meetings</h2>
    <p>
      Builders on YukkuriCraft meet twice a month to plan, give feedback, and build together. The days these meetings
      happens on is the first and third Saturday of every month at 4PM EST(EDT if Daylight saving applies). At those
      times you can find us on our Discord in the Building Room. No matter your skill, Gensokyo is a community project
      so please come and build with us! You can also always contact a Lead Builder at any time if you want to work on
      something.
    </p>

    <h2>Active locations</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a list of builds we are currently working on. If you see anything interesting, contact a Lead Builder to
      get a rundown of the build and a way to contact the person leading it in order to help. Note: If a location isn't
      on this list that doesn't mean you can't help with it. We most likely haven't started on it yet.
